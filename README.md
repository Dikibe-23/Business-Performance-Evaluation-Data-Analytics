# Business-Performance-Evaluation-Data-Analytics
A business performance analytics project.  

## BUSINESS PERFORMANCE SQL, EXCEL & TABLEAU PROJECT

In this project, we explain how a typical Data Analytics or Business Analytics project will be implemented. The steps are explained below;

**1.	Understanding the business problems:** In my view, Data Analytics should follow simple and adaptable approach. That is, it can be fine-tuned to fit any kind of project. Although this is a preliminary step in Data Analytics, it helps you as a Data Analyst understand the business needs and as well discuss about your approach to solving the problem.

Typically, I would begin by consulting with clients and stakeholders to fulfil the step (understanding the business problems) as pointed out. 

**2.	Understanding the business goals:** In this step, we discuss the business goals and preferred performance metrics to evaluate. This leads to information or data gathering. We then have to model the data to ensure it contains the necessary information we need. Finally, we jointly carry out project scoping and planning. With this step we would have created an efficient business workflow that meets the aim, timeframe and budget.

**3.	Taking steps to find a solution:** Here, we implement the project plan whilst keeping stakeholders and clients updated on the progress. This step would often involve creating reports and dashboards of the agreed metrics leveraging various data visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI, Google Looker Studio, MS Excel depending on which tool the business feels most acquainted with. 

The final report would often include a measure of the initial goal against the outcomes. In other words, we interpret the results of our analysis to demonstrate the essence of the project.
